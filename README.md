A small project to encode portraits into 2 dimensions and build a map. The objectives of this project are:

- Political/philosophic: Show that all congress' members look alike, despite their affiliation.

- Technical: Explore the use of ```pipenv``` to control the requeriments, enviroment and tasks of a Python project. Also use ```Keras```, training a model, storing it and applying it later to create a visual result.

## Installation
Use pipenv to install and open a shell. You can use it too to check code style with ```pipenv run style```.

## Scripts
